# Week 4: Geospatial data analysis and visualization

## Goals

This week is an introduction to working with spatial data in R. You will learn spatial data types, new packages to work with and analyze vector (`sf`) and raster (`terra`) data and visualize spatial data with the `tmap` package.

We will also learn of some new R packages you can use to retrieve spatial data from different databases, such as the `rgbif` package which retrieves species occurrence data from the GBIF database and `soilDB` to retrieve snow depth data from SNOTEL sites around the U.S.

## Resources

Here are more resources on working with geospatial data in R: - [List of open-source geospatial datasets](https://github.com/giswqs/geospatial-data-catalogs) - [Visualize spatial data with `ggmap`](https://medium.com/appsilon-data-science/r-ggmap-how-to-visualize-spatial-data-in-r-c46dcf970095)

## Material/Assignment

There are 2 required lesson plans this week that will count towards your assignment. Remeber to first **Fork** this repository then **clone your forked repo**, and save copies of each .Rmd with *your name* appended to the file name. Below are descriptions of each assignment with links to the associated video tutorials:

1.  **01_spatial_intro.Rmd** - Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWrvtdGojDs

2.  **02_spatial_analysis.Rmd** - Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IREppWlPeYw

To submit your assignment, remember to push all your file edits to GitHub and then submit a pull request by clicking 'Contribute' -> 'Open a Pull Request' from the home page of your forked repo. The two assignments above will be due **Monday 11/13**.

As a reminder, it is okay to submit the pull request before you've finished all assignments. Any new file changes pushed to GitHub after will just be appended to your existing pull request.

### Bonus Material

There are a few lessons/challenges that are **not required** but may be worth your time (and extra credit..). Located in the 'bonus/' subfolder, you will find the following files:

- **get_spatial_challenge.Rmd** : Worth up to 3 extra credit points if fully completed
    - Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGHMfDdLWjI

- **spatial_viz.Rmd** : A fun lesson to explore more visualization techniques
